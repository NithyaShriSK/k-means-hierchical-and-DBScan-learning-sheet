# Clustering Learning Sheet

A concise and practical learning resource for practicing and understanding three fundamental clustering algorithms: **Kâ€‘Means**, **Hierarchical (Agglomerative)**, and **DBSCAN**. This notebook-style learning sheet is perfect for students and data scientists exploring unsupervised learning basics.

- **`clustering_learning_sheet.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter Notebook containing minimal, clean clustering examples using synthetic data with inline comments for clarity.

##  Whatâ€™s Inside the Notebook

1. **Data Generation**  
   - Creates synthetic blob data using `sklearn.datasets.make_blobs`, ideal for demonstrating clustering behavior.

2. **Kâ€‘Means Clustering**  
   - Simple implementation with `KMeans` from `sklearn.cluster`.
   - Visualizes clusters with a clear scatter plot.

3. **Hierarchical (Agglomerative) Clustering**  
   - Uses `AgglomerativeClustering`.
   - Demonstrates cluster formation via hierarchical merging.

4. **DBSCAN Clustering**  
   - Density-based clustering using `DBSCAN`.
   - Highlights how outliers are labeled as `-1` and clusters form based on density, not centroids.

The notebook displays clear visual outputs and section headers, making it ideal for reference or teaching.

##  Quick Comparison Table

| Algorithm   | Type            | Pros                                         | Cons                                      |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Kâ€‘Means     | Centroid-based  | Fast, scalable, easy to understand           | Assumes spherical clusters, needs `k`      |
| Hierarchical| Hierarchical    | No need to predefine clusters, builds dendrogram | Not scalable for large datasets         |
| DBSCAN      | Density-based   | Finds clusters of any shape, handles noise    | Sensitive to Îµ (eps) and `min_samples`     |
